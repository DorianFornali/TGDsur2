# TGD/2

Universitary project in the "Génie Logiciel" course of the first year of Computer science master in Université Cote d'Azur.

The goal was to develop a small video game of tower-defense genre by using well designed code and practices.

## Pre-requisites

You need a JVM installed with java 20.0.1
You can find JDKs here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk20-archive-downloads.html

## How to install

<br>
<b>First method:</b>

Download the .jar directly from here, to do so click on the file and then on "raw", your browser should download it.
Then from powershell if you are on windows or your linux terminal:

```bash
java -jar TGDsur2.jar
```

If it doesn't work, please verify that you have Java 20+ installed. 

```bash
java --version
```
<b>Second method:</b>

If you can't start the jar properly, clone the repository locally and execute Main.java from intelliJ IDEA directly. IntelliJ is required as the .iml file handles the dependency injection.
